If your applications like, virt-manager and firefox dont start, they you have an issue with flatpak.


1. run: pacman -Rs flatpak (this will not delete your flatpak apps)
2. run: pacamn -S flatpak
3. choose number 4, the community edition, because 1 creates that problem. (xdg-desktop..... is the cause if this issue) 
4. reboot

Problem should now be fixed.
