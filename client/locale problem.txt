If you made a mistake while installing arch, your locale is not set right. This results in öüä keys messing up your terminal.
You will also see falling back on C locale, when starting an application with terminal.


1. run: echo "LANG=de_CH.utf8" > /etc/locale.conf
2. run: locale-gen
3. reboot

If that doesnt help:
1. run: export LANG=de_CH.utf8
2. reboot

This should fix it, you can check by running a programming with terminal.
